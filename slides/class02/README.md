## A Note on Feedback

500 is a very different course from 431-432 in terms of the "hands on" assistance that I make available to you as you're working on a homework assignment, in part because I don't have a TA for the course. In particular, I'm not going to review your code to be sure you're going in the right direction, even though I understand some of you have come to expect that from 431-432.

Instead, we discuss the HW assignments in class and I provide a detailed answer sketch after the fact. So if you have questions, please feel free to send them, and I'll answer sometimes, but what I am likely to say to anything I cannot resolve quickly for you (or think is worthy of deeper discussion as a group) is: 

1. That sounds like an excellent question to bring up on Thursday in class, and 
2. I'm going to let you (and everyone else) flounder a bit between now and our discussion of this HW in class.
