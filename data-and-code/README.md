# Data and Code for 500, Spring 2018

## The R-Basics Materials: Focused on Data Management and Logistic Regression

I've built several documents to help remind you of some basic things you will need to use in R. [See them here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2018/tree/master/data-and-code/r-basics).

- Hadley Wickham's [Whole Game Video](https://youtu.be/go5Au01Jrvs) with [code and data here](https://github.com/hadley/building-permits) may be of interest. Hadley does a nice job of showing you how people actually do data analysis work.

## The TOY example: Your First Demo for Running a Propensity Analysis

The toy example is 100% fictional, and shows a (relatively) simple way to do some basic propensity score analyses, using a quantitative outcome, a binary outcome, and a time-to-event outcome. In no way would I claim that the approach is in any way optimal. It's just a first demo, but it's got about 95 pages worth of material. You'll [find it here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2018/tree/master/data-and-code/toy_example).

## Sensitivity Spreadsheet: Beware - this was built in 2008

- [Spreadsheet](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2018/blob/master/data-and-code/sensitivityspreadsheet_2008.xls) 
- [Documentation](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2018/blob/master/data-and-code/sensitivitydocumentation_2008.pdf) (10 pages)

# Some Work from Other People

## Elizabeth Stuart's Propensity Score Software Page

- Elizabeth Stuart's [Propensity Score software page](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~estuart/propensityscoresoftware.html) remains incredibly useful.

## Videos To Learn More About Propensity Scores (and if you visit any of these, you'll find many more)

- Jason Roy (Penn) has a Crash Course in Causality [at Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crash-course-in-causality).
- Kristin Rankin has a session on [Propensity Score Matching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZVIfW6_v1U)
- Ben Lambert has a series of YouTube videos on [Propensity Score Matching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0UU6trKR0E)
- Doug McKee has posted [An Intuitive Introduction to Propensity Score Matching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACVyPp1Fy6Y)
- Gary King has a lecture entitled [Why Propensity Scores Should Not Be Used for Matching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBv39pK1iEs)

## Software

- Noah Griefer's [cobalt vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cobalt/vignettes/cobalt_basic_use.html)
- RAND corporation's [TWANG package materials](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/twang/index.html)
- Luke Keele's [Rbounds package](http://www.personal.psu.edu/ljk20/rbounds.html)
- A student of mine, David Ngendahimana, is working on the problem of improving the link between covariate balance and improved sensitivity in selecting a matching procedure. We hope to have something arXived and available for testing on github in the Spring, but David is finishing the other two-thirds of his dissertation first. David is at `dkn18 at case dot edu`.
