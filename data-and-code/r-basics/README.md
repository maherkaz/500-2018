# R-Basics

This section has some useful information to remind you of some things when using R.

- The [500-r-basics.pdf](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2018/blob/master/data-and-code/r-basics/500-r-basics.pdf) PDF file and the [500-r-basics.Rmd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2018/master/data-and-code/r-basics/500-r-basics.Rmd) R Markdown file remind/show you how to do a number of things you'll need, especially in the early homework assignments.
    - This includes some data management, some fundamental statistical inference ideas, and (especially) some logistic regression.
    - This document is a little old now, and so it may not use the best approaches I am now teaching in 432.
- Some general [Tips on Using R Studio and R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2018/blob/master/data-and-code/r-basics/500-2018-Tips%20on%20Using%20R%20Studio%20and%20R%20Markdown.pdf) are also available.
- You may also want to look at the [old homework 1 assignment](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2018/tree/master/assignments/homework1/oldhw1) (from 2016 and earlier) and its [associated answer sketch](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2018/tree/master/assignments/homework1/oldhw1).
