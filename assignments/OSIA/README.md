# Observational Studies in Action

During the semester, you will be responsible for presenting the methods and results of an observational study from the literature that uses propensity score methods. The study must be approved before March 1 by Dr. Love, and you can submit your claim on a study any time in the month of February. 

## What makes an appropriate study?

An appropriate study will 

- use (or at least primarily use) methods we will discuss in class (hence the need for Dr. Love's pre-approval)
- be a fully published manuscript, not a work in progress, published since 2010 with a PDF file of the study itself and any appendix materials that can be shared with the class (so journals that are available to all CWRU affiliates are preferable)
- **not** be one that you or your immediate supervisor have been involved in, and not be one that I have been involved in, in any capacity, and not be one that is included on our [Texts page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2018/tree/master/texts).

## Claiming a Study

Everyone will present a different study. To submit a study for approval, send a PDF of the study itself along with any appendix materials to Dr. Love in an email entitled "OSIA proposal" and include a brief (100 words is sufficient, in the body of your email) description of why this particular study is of interest to you. Please be sure to specify that you meet all of the standards listed above.

- If you select a study that is unsuitable, Dr. Love will let you know as soon as he can.
- If you select an acceptable study and you are the first to "claim" it, it's yours. Once a study is claimed, Dr. Love will post it here. If you select a study that someone else has beaten you to, you will have to submit an alternative.

## Your Presentation

You will give a 15-minute presentation of the background, methods and key results of the study. 

- I suggest you plan on spending about half of the time discussing the statistical and design considerations.
- I strongly encourage you to provide useful graphs to summarize key findings.

If you like, you can adapt the [outline I suggest for your final project proposal](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2018/tree/master/projects/final#the-presentation) for this task, although I would encourage you to think hard about what might be most useful to us in this context, rather than just applying that plan.

## Second Reviewer

For each OSIA study, a "second reviewer" will be assigned in March once all studies are established (so that everyone does this job once.) The "second reviewer" for each study will provide 3-5 minutes of commentary on the study after the study is presented by the main reviewer.

## Audience Role

For each OSIA study, everyone will read the abstracts in advance, so that we can have some understanding of what's involved. The abstracts will also be posted to this section of the site.
