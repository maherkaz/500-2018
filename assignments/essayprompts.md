# Prompts for Essays in reaction to Rosenbaum's *Observation and Experiment*

Prior to the start of discussion about Chapters 7-13, you will produce an essay of **175-250 words** each week in reaction to a prompt related to that week's chapter.

- You will submit each essay before class begins. Submission details to come.
- These essays will be shared with the rest of the class. 
- Note that the first few prompts are between 100 and 111 words in length, so that in most cases a response of about double the length of the prompt should be your goal.

### Prompt for Chapter 7 (Elaborate Theories) due before [Class 4](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2018/blob/master/SCHEDULE.md)

Provide an example of how an elaborate theory might be used to improve the design of an observational study with which you are familiar, either one you have been directly involved in, or one you've read about, or one you'd like to be able to do. Provide a basic description of your study's population, outcome, treatment and covariates so we can follow your logic. Be sure to demonstrate how you believe your elaborate theory will help to choose between alternative hypotheses, keeping in mind Cochran's suggestion that "the task of deciding between alternative hypotheses is made easier, since they may agree in predicting some consequences but will differ in others."

### Prompt for Chapter 8 (Quasi-Experimental Devices) due before [Class 5](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2018/blob/master/SCHEDULE.md)

Provide an example of how the method of multiple control groups might be used to improve the design of an observational study with which you are familiar, either one you have been directly involved in, or one you've read about, or one you'd like to be able to do. Provide a basic description of your study's population, outcome, treatment and control conditions and covariates of interest so we can follow your logic. Be sure to specify the approach you would take in implementing multiple control groups, and the ways in which you expect the use of multiple control groups to be helpful in improving your understanding of the phenomenon you're studying. 

### Prompt for Chapter 9 (Sensitivity to Bias) due before [Class 6](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2018/blob/master/SCHEDULE.md)

In one of Dr. Love's papers using matched propensity-score analysis, a significant result was obtained favoring the treatment group over a control, and the calculated sensitivity parameter value was 1.5. Now imagine that you did a study and obtained such a result. Provide a basic description of your imaginary study's population, outcome, treatment and covariates so we can follow your logic. Provide a description of what that value means in English, and discuss how your reaction to the study and its importance might differ if the significance level was unchanged but the sensitivity parameter had instead been 1.1, or 2.0.

### Prompt for Chapter 10 (Design Sensitivity) due before [Class 7](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2018/blob/master/SCHEDULE.md)

Describe an example from your own experience (or use your imagination, as needed) that can be modified to reduce sensitivity to unmeasured bias, either by restricting the comparison groups to more intensive receipt or lack of receipt of treatment, or by identifying a subgroup of subjects who are likelier to exhibit a treatment effect. As usual, provide a basic description of your imaginary study's population, outcome, treatment and covariates so we can follow your logic.

### Prompt for Chapter 11 (Matching Techniques) due before [Class 8](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2018/blob/master/SCHEDULE.md)

Describe the most important thing (or things) that you learned from reading Chapter 11 that you didn't already know from our in-class discussions of matching. In particular, specify how this new material might change your approach to your future work, ideally in the context of an actual study you're doing (perhaps your project) or a study you hope to do in the future.

### Prompt for Chapter 12 (Biases from General Dispositions) due before [Class 9](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2018/blob/master/SCHEDULE.md)

Describe how one of the unmeasured generic biases described in this Chapter has affected your life or work. Mask the details to protect anonymity and avoid embarassment if appropriate, but provide us with sufficient background that we can understand the potential for confusion and bias if the situation was to be analyzed in terms of a comparison of treatment effects.

### Prompt for Chapter 13 (Instruments) due before [Class 11](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2018/blob/master/SCHEDULE.md)

Provide an example of how a method described in Chapter 13 might be used to improve the design of an observational study with which you are familiar, either one you have been directly involved in, or one you've read about, or one you'd like to be able to do. Provide a basic description of your study's population, outcome, treatment and control conditions and covariates of interest so we can follow your logic. Be sure to specify the approach you would take in implementing your instrument, nudge or encouragement analysis, and how you expect such an approach to be helpful in improving your understanding of the phenomenon you're studying.
