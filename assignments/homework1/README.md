# Homework 1 for 500 - 2018

1. Visit https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/teaching/ and request copies of the DIG "teaching" data set.
2. Review the documentation available to you on the BIOLINCC page, or on our Assignments page, and complete a **mock proposal** for an observational study based on the available DIG data, based on that information.
    + Upload a Google Doc containing your proposal to the team drive. 
    + Restrict yourself to one page.

## Questions to be addressed in the Mock Proposals

1. What comparison do you want to make?
    + Did patients receiving "EXPOSURE A" have lower rates of "BAD OUTCOME" than those who received "EXPOSURE B"?
2. Why is this of interest?
    + "OUTCOME" is important because ...
    + "EXPOSURE" (A or B) is important because ...
    + (*Be sure to clearly indicate what you hypothesize the effect of EXPOSURE on OUTCOME to be.*)
3. What are the key measures - specifically, the exposure/treatment, the primary outcome, and important covariates that are available in the data to help address your question of interest?
    + Exposure/Treatment = A or B, and be sure to specify the way in which you will know which exposure someone receives, and whether the exposure / treatment is applied using a randomized approach, or not.
    + Outcome = ..., and be sure to specify the variables you will use to determine the outcome, as well as the *type* of outcome, be it continuous, categorical (and if categorical, binary or multi-categorical) or survival (and if survival, is censoring involved?) 
    + Covariates of interest: We'd be interested in anything related to treatment choice or to outcome. You should provide a list of such variables of interest. Remember to include **ONLY** things which are measured prior to the exposure/treatment of interest, or which are not possibly changed by it.
