# Old Homework 1

In 2016 and earlier, I occasionally used a different first homework assignment. Looking it over may be helpful in doing your assignments.

Here is that [old assignment](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2018/blob/master/assignments/homework1/oldhw1/500-old-hw1-assignment.pdf) and [the data set](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2018/master/assignments/homework1/oldhw1/oldhw1.csv) it used.

Here is a [R Markdown file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2018/master/assignments/homework1/oldhw1/old-homework1-answer-sketch.Rmd) of my answer sketch for the old assignment, and [here is the PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2018/blob/master/assignments/homework1/oldhw1/old-homework1-answer-sketch.pdf) produced by that Markdown file.

Remember that the [Data and Code section of this site](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2018/tree/master/data-and-code) contains some additional examples of R code that may be helpful. I draw your attention in particular to the [R-basics section](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2018/tree/master/data-and-code/r-basics).
