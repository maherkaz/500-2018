# Assignments for 500, Spring 2018

The course requires you to complete four types of "assignments" and a total of 18 deliverables.

## Course Project - 3 deliverables

1. a **proposal** which you will submit for my approval in February (you should expect the need to do a revision or two) and you will need to receive my approval by March 1.
2. an **update** verifying that you have the data and are proceeding appropriately, due April 1.
3. a final 20-minute **presentation** to the class about your results, due April 19, although some presentations will be given on April 26.

More details on the Course Project [are available here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2018/tree/master/projects).

## Observational Studies in Action - 3 deliverables

Another requirement of the course is an *Observational Studies in Action* presentation where you will describe a published study that uses propensity score methods to address causal effect estimation in an observational study. The two deliverables are:

1. a **study claim** which you will submit in February and you will need to receive my approval on this as well by March 1.
2. a 15-minute **presentation** of your study to the class, either in class 9, 10, 11 or 12.
3. You'll also act as "second reader" for one of your colleagues' presentations and give a short reaction to their presentation.

More details on the Observational Studies in Action work [is available here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2018/tree/master/assignments/OSIA).

## Essays in reaction to Rosenbaum's text - 7 deliverables

You'll write one essay (of 175-250 words) regarding each of seven chapters from Rosenbaum's *Observation & Experiment* text, specifically Chapters 7 - 13, in response to [prompts I have provided](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2018/blob/master/assignments/essayprompts.md). This work begins with Class 4. 

## Homework Assignments - 5 deliverables

You'll do **five homework assignments**, the first of which is due at the start of Class 2. These mostly require you to do some analyses (using R and R Markdown) on realistic but not real data I will provide. These are ungraded for quality - just for completion, and give you an opportunity to practice or develop coding skills in a low-stakes environment.
