# Assignments for 500, Spring 2018

The course requires you to complete four types of "assignments." 

1. An *Observational Studies in Action* presentation - details [here](.

2. A Course Project - details here.

3. Five **homework** assignments usually require you to do some analyses (using R and R Markdown) on data I will provide to you, clustered in January through early March. These are largely ungraded, and give you an opportunity to practice or develop coding skills in a low-stakes environment. The assignments are posted on this page, below.

4. Beginning with Class 4, you will produce an **essay** of 175-250 words each week in reaction to a prompt related to that week's chapter from Rosenbaum's *Observation & Experiment* text. The prompts are [available here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2018/blob/master/assignments/essayprompts.md).
