# Task 2: The Project Update

## Submission

The Project Update can be submitted through canvas.case.edu any time in March, but is due at noon on April 1.

## Details

The update should include answers to the following questions:

1. How has your abstract changed from your approved project proposal?
    - Your update should include an edited version of the proposal you got approved initially, with additional materials and edits in reaction to my comments, and in reaction to changes that have occurred (i.e. I hope you will have details now on exactly how many observations you have, what the covariates are, etc.) â€“ this might be as much as 2-3 pages, but is basically just an edited version of what you've already submitted.
    
2. Describe the data - tell me what you have, and what you are still waiting for. 
    - Please provide a one (or more, if you need it) sentence data description statement that says something like the following...
        - I have the data, and I have imported it into R, and I have completed some recoding of variables and preliminary analyses.
        - Assuming the statement I have provided here is true, that's enough for me to see now. If you've done more than this, I don't need the details in this context.
        - If the statement here is not true because you haven't gotten to that point yet, I'm going to want details on where you are and what the problem is, and I'm going to want those details well before April 1, so I can make suggestions about what to do.

3. Describe the biggest problem you're currently having with regard to completing the design and analysis of the study. Feel free to describe multiple problems, especially if I can help. 
    - Write a paragraph (or more, if you need it) describing the major problems you're currently having. 
        - Or, if you have no major problems, tell me that, and describe the minor problems. 
        - Or, if you have no problems at all, tell me that, and tell me what you still plan to do.
        
You are welcome to include additional information in your update, but these three items are all I need.
