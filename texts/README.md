# Text for Spring 2018

As the semester progresses, we are going to read a book together that you'll need to obtain as soon as possible.

- Paul Rosenbaum's *Observation and Experiment: An Introduction to Causal Inference*, published in 2017 by Harvard University Press. The ISBN-13 number is 978-0674975576. The book is available electronically or in hardcover from Amazon and other retailers.
- Details on when we'll read each chapter of the book are available in the Course Schedule. I encourage you to read Chapters 1-4 as soon as possible, certainly before Class 2 begins on 2018-01-25.

# Other References and Resources

Many additional sources will be presented and referenced in class, and those are gathered below, along with other references that I've used in the past. The PDF files [are available here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2018/tree/master/texts). Some are password-protected. The password will be revealed at the first class.
